# Repository guidance

- Follow Inferno conventions and prefer its configuration files, device tables,
  runtime capability checks, and `waserror`/`poperror` mechanism.
- Do not use `#ifdef` or other preprocessor conditionals to select platform or
  architecture behavior unless the difference cannot reasonably be expressed
  through Inferno configuration or runtime capability handling. Document the
  necessity next to any unavoidable conditional.
